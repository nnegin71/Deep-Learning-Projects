# Binary-Mood-Classifier
Using Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) to develop a binary classifier for mood detection

Goal:

Building a Sequential ConvNet to determine whether the people in the image is smiling or not.â€¯

Data Source:

In this project, "Happy House" dataset is used, which contains images of peoples' faces.

Steps:

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
2. Creating the Sequential ConvNet Model
3. Model Training and Evaluation
