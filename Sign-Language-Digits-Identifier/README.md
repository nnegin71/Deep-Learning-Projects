# Sign-Language-Digits-Identifier
Using Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) to develop a functional API for multi-class classification of sign language digits

Goal:

Building a functional ConvNet to classify multi-class sign digits.â€¯

Data Source:

In this project, "Signdataset" is used, which contains images of hand postures showing 6 digits (0 to 5).

Steps:

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
2. Creating the Sequential ConvNet Model
3. Model Training and Evaluation
