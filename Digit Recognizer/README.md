# Digit Recognizer
Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to determine the digit presented as an image.

This project is one of the Kaggle competition projects, where some deep learning concepts such as train-test data split , dataset/dataloader, multi-class classification, and convolutional NN are explored.
PyTorch platform is used to develope the CNN model and evaluate its performance using accuracy metric. 

**Goal:**
Determine the digit number presented as an imageâ€¯ 

**Data Source:**
https://www.kaggle.com

#### Steps:
1. Loading and exploring data 
2. Dividing data into training and validation sets
3. Creating dataset and data loaders
4. Developing CNN model using PyTorch
5. Tuning CNN model, monitoring training loss and validation accuracy in each epoch
6. Plotting loss and accuracy metrics
7. Evaluating model performance by monitoring couple of miss-classified examples
8. Generating output result for test dataset
